# CarShop

The file contains sales data
cars. In each row there is a seller who is sold by car (composed of ˇ
numbers and letters), car brand and price. These three data are separated by a space.
The program first prints the codes of the three most successful sales based on the total sales amounts. ˇ
The codes are described below the second order of performance. Each code is printed with each code
the amount earned by the seller, separated by a blank space. The program then prints the three most sold ˇ
car brands based on the number of cars sold. The stamps are printed one below
others. The number of copies sold is printed next to each one.
